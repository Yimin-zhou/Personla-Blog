## Ideas:
- I wanted to create a warm scene that was a bit more stylized, so I quickly thought of an attic scene at the end of the movie `Player One`. The clutter and the pop culture posters on the wall.
- I also use the scene designer's original drawings on ArtStation as reference.
- The scene was made in UE.

## Process: 
### 1. 
- First, make the general attic scene with a Blockout tool.

- In order to facilitate after the build a good white mold on the material directly in the scene, or use BSP according to build again.

- After adjusting the length and height of the attic, use some of Quixel's free materials to see the effect under the default light source  .

- Import the beveled pillar into Blender and simply chamfer it to make the edges look better.

- Simply tried baking the lighting

- Start building the details of the scene, mainly using quixel's free materials.

- (spelled out with a wooden board)

- Continue to enrich the scene with details.

### 2. Lighting: 
- After the scene is almost built, start adjusting the lighting, because the scene mainly uses baked lighting, so the accuracy of the light map is very important.

- Turn off the default light source in the scene and create a directional light and a sky light

- Adjust the lightmass world settings, the lighting bounces mainly affect the indirect light in the scene, turn them up.

- Use an HDRI as the scene's ambient light (HDRI HEAVEN)

- Add a reflection sphere to enhance the reflection effect, and then use ue's volume fog and directional light to make a light ray effect.

- Wrap the scene to prevent baking light leaks!

### 3. Post-processing:
- LUT:

Post-processing is mainly to adjust the saturation and Gamma, turn on the ambient light masking, so that the picture color is more vivid, add a little blue, so that the picture is not so yellow.

- Added more details (posters).

- Add some more film effects to give the image a dated look.

- Effects.

- Feel a little too bright indoor objects, reduce the intensity of indirect light, pull up the light mapping precision, baking!
- Final effect:
