# Targeted effects.
- Ice with volume

# Process.
- To achieve a sense of volume in the ice, the reflection vector is used to offset the sampling of the mapping. This way, the map is shifted differently in different perspectives to achieve a sense of volume.

- First get the reflection vector and use a normal map to get a bumpy ice surface. Lerp the reflection vector with the camera vector to get some variations.

- Then calculate the offset of the depth. The xy of the reflection vector is multiplied by the z-value and a parameter and a noise map are used to control the z-value. This allows you to control the offset of the mapping when turning the view with the parameter and the offset at different positions with the noise map.

- The calculated offset is added to the UV and the mapping is output to Basecolor.

- The current effect, you can see that it already looks a bit like ice.

- The next step is to add more detail, sample another mapping, and lerp blend with the base color above.

- Sample another crack mapping, this one will not need to be offset and placed at the very surface.

- Also add self-illumination.

- Plus blending with other materials.
